# Getting Started

## Installing and Launching TaskHub

### Step 1: Install Java

Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed on your computer. If you don't have Java installed, follow the steps in [Appendix A: Installing Java](#appendix-a-installing-java).

### Step 2: Download TaskHub

Download the latest `taskhub.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-3/tp/releases).

### Step 3: Set up TaskHub Home Folder

Copy or move the downloaded `taskhub.jar` file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your TaskHub.

### Step 4: Launch TaskHub

1. Open a terminal (MacOS) or command prompt (Windows).

2. Navigate to the folder where you placed the `taskhub.jar` file using the `cd` command. For example, our friendly TaskHubber has his `taskhub.jar` file in `/Users/timothyleow/Developer/TaskHub`, so he'll run:

    ```bash
    cd /Users/timothyleow/Developer/TaskHub
    ```

3. Verify that your working directory contains `taskhub.jar` by using the `ls` command. You should see `taskhub.jar` in the list of files printed. Here's what our friendly TaskHubber got when running this command.

    ```bash
    timothyleow@timleows-MBP TaskHub % ls
    taskhub.jar
    ```

4. Once your terminal's working directory is the folder that contains `taskhub.jar`, run the following command to launch TaskHub:

    ```bash 
    java -jar taskhub.jar
    ```

   After executing this command, a graphical user interface (GUI) similar to the one below should appear shortly:

   Note: The application comes with some sample data for your reference.

## Understanding the components of TaskHub

---
### Employees


<img src="images/Employee.png" width="400">

An `Employee` is someone that you are managing. TaskHub allows you to store their essential details and `tag` them with their strengths and weaknesses so you can allocate them to suitable [`Projects`](#projects) or [`Tasks`](#tasks).

#### Attributes:

| Field        | Description                                                    | Prefix for [`addE`](#add-an-employee-adde) |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Name         | Name of the employee.                                          | `n/`                                       |
| Phone Number | Phone number of the employee.                                  | `p/`                                       |
| Email        | Email address of the employee.                                 | `e/`                                       |
| Address      | Address of the employee.                                       | `a/`                                       |
| Tags         | Tags indicating strengths/weaknesses/position of the employee. | `t/`                                       |

---

### Projects
<img src="images/Project.png" width="400">


A `Project` in TaskHub is a managerial unit that includes information about [`Employees`](#employee) allocated to the project and an (optionally) set [deadline](#edit-deadline-of-a-projects-dlp). You can [mark](#mark-projects-as-completed-markp) a `Project` as done when you deem fit. Additionally, you can add `Tasks` to a `Project`.
#### Attributes:

| Field            | Description                                                | Prefix for [`addP`](#add-a-new-project-addp) | Relevant Command(s)                                                                             |

| Employees        | Employees assigned to the project.                         | `em/`                                        | [`assignP`](#assign-employees-to-a-project-assignp)                                             |
| Deadline         | Deadline for the project.                                  | -                                            | [`dlP`](#edit-deadline-of-a-projects-dlp)                                                       |

---

### Tasks

<img src="images/Tasks.png" width="400">

A `Task` in TaskHub represents a specific job within a `Project` that can be assigned to an `Employee` under that `Project`. Tasks are required to have a deadline. Managing `Task`s will be the main way of monitoring the work done within your `TaskHub`!

#### Attributes:

| Field    | Description                            | Prefix for [`addT`](#add-a-new-task-to-a-project-addt) | Relevant Command                                                                          |
|----------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Name     | Name of the task.                      | `n/`                                                   | -                                                                                         |
| Employee | Employee assigned to the task.         | `em/`                                                  | [`assignT`](#assign-an-employee-to-a-task-assignt)                                        |
| Deadline | Deadline for completing the task.      | `d/`                                                   | -                                                                                         |
| isDone   | Indicates whether the task is complete.| N.A.                                                   | [`markT`](#mark-tasks-as-completed-markt), [`unmarkT`](#mark-tasks-as-incomplete-unmarkt) |

## Understanding the User Interface (UI)

![Ui Parts](images/UiParts.png)

TaskHub's UI consists of 4 main parts that you will be using for your project management:

### Menu Bar
* The menu bar is where you can exit TaskHub or even open the help window with a simple click of your mouse!
* While commands to exit TaskHub or open the help window can be entered as a command, this is a beginner-friendly alternative for newer users who might not be so familiar with the commands.

#### Help:
Upon clicking help on the menu bar as shown below or by using the shortcut `F1`,

![circled_help_gui](images/circledHelpGui.png)

a help window pops up with a list of all the possible commands:

![help window](images/HelpWindow.png)

and at the bottom of the window, is a link to our user guide.

![ug_link](images/HelpWindowUgLink.png)

### Command Panel
* The command panel is the main panel that you will be interacting with to key in commands and also get back the results of those commands.
* The upper box is where you can type in your command.
* And the lower box is where you will see the results of those commands.

### Employee Panel
* The employee panel is one of two panels that you can use to see what is stored in TaskHub.
* The employee panel, as the name suggests, is where all the information about each employee is stored.
* You can see their name, phone number, address, email address, and even whatever tags that you have for each of them as needed!

### Project Panel
* The project panel is the other panel that you will be using to see the data stored in TaskHub.
* Projects, as well as their members, tasks to complete in the project, and other important details for managing your project are stored here!

[Return to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

## Quick start
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">

**:warning: Warning:** The first step in the Quick Start guide involves `deleteP`, which is irreversible. If you wish to keep the sample data, then you can head straight to the [Features](#features) section below to figure out TaskHub on your own.

</div>

If you're okay with modifying the sample data, then we'll proceed with our first gist of project management with TaskHub. Time is ticking!

At this point, you should have installed Java 11 and be able to to run TaskHub without issues. If you haven't done so, you may return to the [Installation Guide](#installing-and-launching-taskhub).

If all is well, TaskHub should look something like this when you first run it:

<img src="images/QuickStartStart.png" width="700">

### Step 1: Deleting a finished project
Hmmm, it seems like you're done with the 'Website Redesign Project'. Let's get rid of this data by running the below command.

```
deleteP 1
```

You should get the following response:

```
Deleted Project: 
Name: Website Redesign;
Completed? Yes;
Deadline: 15-11-2023;
Priority: HIGH
Members: Alex Yeoh, Bernice Yu
```
Now, you're looking at the 'Market Expansion' project, which we'll be focusing on.


### Step 2: Adding a new employee to TaskHub:
You've just got an email from your boss, saying that the fresh graduate that you recently interviewed is joining your team!

Here are his details:

| Name         | Anton Tan                       |
|--------------|---------------------------------|
| Phone Number | 98765432                        |
| Email        | anton@mail.com                  |
| Address      | Anton Street, block 123, #01-01 |
| Strengths    | TeamPlayer, Hardworking         |

Let's run the following command to add him to your team of [`Employees`](#employees).

```
addE n/Anton Tan p/98765432 e/anton@mail.com
 a/Anton Street, block 123, #01-01 t/TeamPlayer t/Hardworking
```

You should get the following response:
```
New employee added: Anton Tan;
Phone: 98765432;
Email: anton@mail.com;
Address: Anton Street, block 123, #01-01;
Tags: [TeamPlayer][Hardworking]
```

### Step 3: Assigning an Employee to a Project in TaskHub:
You've decided that you need more help with the 'Market Expansion Project'. Let's run the following command to enlist Anton's help:
```
assignP pr/1 em/7
```

You should get the following response:
```
Member(s) have been assigned!
Name: Market Expansion; Completed? No; Deadline: 30-12-2023; Priority: NORMAL
Members: Charlotte Oliveiro, David Li, Anton Tan
```

### Step 4: Adding a Task to a Project:
Anton is eager to contribute to his newly assigned project. Since you've found that he is particularly skilled at Market Segmentation, let's run the following command to give him a task that he will excel at. To measure his capabilities, you'll only give him until the end of November to complete this.
```
addT n/Market Segmentation pr/1 em/3 d/30-11-2023 2359
```

You should get the following response:
```
New task added to project 1, 
Description: Market Segmentation;
Deadline: 30 Nov 2023, 11:59PM;
Assignee: Anton Tan
```

### Step 5: Marking a Task as Complete:
It's the next morning. You receive an eager email from Anton reporting that he's already completed the Market Segmentation `Task`. After reviewing his report, you are thoroughly impressed and wish to mark his work as done in `TaskHub`. Let's run this command:
```
markT pr/1 t/3
```

You should get the following response:
```
1 task(s) marked as completed under the project: Market Expansion
```

If you've followed the steps correctly, TaskHub should look something like this now:

Scroll down in the `Employees` pane to notice Anton, the newest addition to your team.

For a more comprehensive overview of what you can achieve with TaskHub, you may proceed to the [Features](#features) section below.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `addE n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `addE n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* All commands that can take in multiple index**es** should have its indexes separated by **single** spaces.<br>
e.g. if the command specifies `INDEX [MORE_INDEXES]`, it should be entered as `1 2 3` instead of `1  2  3`.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `listE`, `listP`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* Commands that contain `[MORE INDEXES]` are able to take in more than one index for the relevant parameter, separated by spaces.<br>
  e.g. `1`, `2 5 4`, `3 7`

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## Data Storage

### Save the data

TaskHub's data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Edit the data file

TaskHub data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/taskhub.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">

:no_entry: **Danger:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, TaskHub will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.
More details are provided under the [FAQ Section](#faq). <br>

# FAQ

**Q**: Why is all my TaskHub data gone?<br>
**A**: Most likely, your data is still mostly intact, so it is recommended to exit the app first by manually closing the window or the shortcut `Alt + F4` as executing some commands such as `addE`,`exit` and `clear` will clear the previously stored data in this situation.
Taskhub may appear empty as it requires all data stored in the data file to be in the correct format so that it can be read back to TaskHub. A TaskHub that suddenly becomes empty indicates an issue with the data file.<br>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source:
**The solution below assumes that you are familiar with files in the `.json` format, and how TaskHub stores data. If you are unfamiliar, please check out** **[this website](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp) to know more about `.json` files** <br>
If you have directly changed any data in the `taskhub.json` file instead of through TaskHub, it is highly likely that it would be in the wrong format, resulting in an empty TaskHub.<br>
To attempt to recover as much data as possible, it is recommended to save a copy of the `taskhub.json` file somewhere else and perform the following actions:<br>
1. Remove all projects from your `taskhub.json` file. (`"projects" : []` should be the result after this operation, like the image shown below)<br>
![Data file with only employees](images/DataFileWithoutProjects.png)
2. Run TaskHub with the edited `taskhub.json` file. If the list of employees is shown, then the problem lies in your projects. Otherwise, a format error lies in the `"employee"` section of your json file. 
It is recommended to start from scratch because most likely your projects and tasks that involve the employee have different degree of changes, and it might be impractical to manually change each occurence of the employee.  
3. Now, add each project one by one, ensuring that TaskHub can run normally after each project addition. If TaskHub appears empty after the addition of a particular project, it is most likely that the employees in the project are different from those stored in TaskHub.
Check the employees assigned in your project and employees assigned to relevant tasks, making sure every field is equal to its counterpart in the employee list.<br>
While checking an employee assigned to a task, make sure the employee is the same employee in the project and in the employee list. Each project should have this format:
![Data file with a project](images/DataFileWithProject.png)
4. Repeat the step above until every project is added to TaskHub.<br>
If you have not changed anything, ensure your `data` folder containing your `taskhub.json` is in the same folder as your `taskhub.jar`.<br>

</div>

**Q**: Why is TaskHub not loading for me?<br>
**A**: If you did modify your `taskhub.json` file, it is most likely that you put the keyword `null` somewhere in the json file. Removing these keywords should at least present to you an empty TaskHub.<br>
Another possibility is that your `taskhub.log` or `taskhub.json` files are set to read-only.<br>
The first step is to open the folder that contains all your files related to TaskHub.
* For Windows users, right-click each file in your file explorer, click on properties and untick `Read-only` in `Attributes`.<br>
* For MacOS users, for each file in Finder choose `File` > `Get Info` > `Sharing & Permissions`. Set the privilege for yourself to be `Read & Write`.<br>
* For Linux users, run `chmod a+rw *` in your terminal. If you have difficulty navigating to your directory that contains the files, check out the "Navigation and Exploration" section of [this website](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/basic-linux-navigation-and-file-management).<br> 


**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous TaskHub home folder.

# Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.

## Appendix A: Installing Java

Follow these steps to install Java on your computer:

1. **Download Java 11:**
  - Download Java 11 from [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/sg/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html) based on your operating system.

2. **Follow the instructions on Oracle's website**
   - Go to the appropriate guide page and follow the instructions based on your operating system to complete the installation.
     - [MacOS](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/installation-jdk-macos.html#GUID-2FE451B0-9572-4E38-A1A5-568B77B146DE)
     - [Windows](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/installation-jdk-microsoft-windows-platforms.html#GUID-A7E27B90-A28D-4237-9383-A58B416071CA)
     - [Linux](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/installation-jdk-linux-platforms.html#GUID-737A84E4-2EFF-4D38-8E60-3E29D1B884B8)

3. **Verify Installation:**
   After installation, open a terminal (on MacOS) or Command Prompt (on Windows) and run the following commands to verify that Java is installed:

  ```
   java -version
  ```
If installed correctly, you should see version information for both Java and the Java Compiler. The message should look something like this:
```
openjdk version "11.0.20" 2023-07-18 LTS
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Zulu11.66+15-CA (build 11.0.20+8-LTS)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Zulu11.66+15-CA (build 11.0.20+8-LTS, mixed mode)
