### Project: TaskHub

TaskHub is a desktop project management application used by project managers to manage projects and their team members in each project. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project. 

* **New Feature**: Added the mark/unmark tasks commands ([\#143](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-3/tp/pull/143))
  * What it does: Lets the user set the completion status of a task.
  * Justification: Allows users to know which tasks are not yet completed, which makes it easier for them to track the progress of their projects.

* **New Feature**: Added the find projects command ([\#108](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-3/tp/pull/108))
  * What it does: Lets the user search for specific projects by name, with the provided keywords. It also filters the employees down to those who are under these projects.
  * Justification: Allows users to filter out specific projects and the relevant employees for easier project tracking.

* **New Feature**: Added the list projects/list projects and employees commands ([\#101](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-3/tp/pull/101) and [\#110](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-3/tp/pull/110))
  * What it does: Lets the user list out all existing projects/all existing projects and employees respectively.
  * Justification: Allows users to see all projects and/or employees at a glance.

* **New Feature**: Added the sort tasks command ([\#158](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-3/tp/pull/158))
  * What it does: Lets the user sort tasks in each project by completion status (incomplete before completed) and deadline (earlier before later).
  * Justification: Allows users to better visualize the progress of task completion in each project.

* **Ui Feature/Enhancement**: Added a Ui panel and cards for projects ([\#89](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-3/tp/pull/89))

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=chandan8186&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&since=2023-09-22)

  * Contributed to setting agendas for team meetings.

  * Managed the latest [milestone 1.3 release](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-3/tp/releases/tag/v1.3.2).

* **Enhancements to existing feature**: Modified the find employees command ([\#108](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-3/tp/pull/108))
  * What it does: It now filters the projects down to those that contain the filtered employees (in addition to filtering out employees).
  * Justification: Allows users to filter out specific employees and the relevant projects for easier employee management.

* **Review/mentoring contributions**:
  * Some of the PRs reviewed (among others) with non-trivial comments:
