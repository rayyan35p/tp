### Project: TaskHub

TaskHub is a desktop project management application used by project managers to manage projects and their team members in each project. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code Contribution**:[RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=antontan96&breakdown=false&sort=groupTitle%20dsc&sortWithin=title&since=2023-09-22&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos)


* `Project` model: 
  * Created the infrastructure for projects in `model` files.
  * Created `JsonAdaptedProject` for projects to be locally stored in TaskHub.
  * Updated `TaskHub` to store `Projects` using `UniqueProjectList` (inspired by `UniqueEmployeeList`)


* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add and delete projects.
  * What it does: Lets the user add and delete new projects to TaskHub.
  * Justification: The core feature of TaskHub is to manage projects for project managers. Users will need to add and delete projects first to plan how projects should proceed.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to assign employees to projects.
  * What it does: Lets the user assign employees to be a part of a project.
  * Justification: Allows users to add employees to a project, so that they can better manage how many people should be in a project.

* **Enhancements to Existing Feature**:
  * Enhance Storage Validation to make sure that Employees assigned to a project are exactly the same as its counterpart stored in TaskHub.
  * Made the Main Window look better when window exceeds a certain height[\#149](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-3/tp/pull/149)
  * Refactored `Remark` to `Project`
* **Icon Design**: Designed the icon for TaskHub. <br> ![TaskHubIcon](./../images/task_hub_32.png)

        * Added documentation for the features `addP`,`assignP`,`deleteP`
        * Added solutions for the FAQ section.
        * Added sections to the Command Summary.
    * Developer Guide:
        * Added Use Case Scenarios.
        * Updated the Storage section to fit our application.
        * Documented the design of Add Projects command and Storage Validation.

* **Team-based Tasks**:
  * Submitted product concept and User Guide draft.
